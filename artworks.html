          <h5>ART 74 | Composition | Photoshop, Illustrator</h5>
          <img
            src="https://cdn.glitch.me/ed8c583e-28ae-4141-aeb9-e53177706ad7%2FHe_DigitalImageComposition_2.png?v=1633546982226"

          <p>
            I was inspired by one of the examples for this assignment (a
            composition full of random landmarks and you had to find a certain
            one) and it reminded me of Where's Waldo. So I playfully call this
            "Where's Doggo?". It was originally going to be normal cat photos
            but I started adding meme cats instead and even added one little cat
            drawing using Illustrator, and the dog is, of course, Doge. This was
            an experimentation using Illustrator and Photoshop.

          <p class="ex1"></p>
          <p>
            This was one of the first experimentations I've had with Glitch Art.
            The assignment was to grab an image off google and distort it, and I
            decided to specifically do a scene of a person standing in the rain.
            The idea's inspired by a cybernetic/sci-fi theme have the girl
            duplicated into broken clones and having a distortion in the rain.

          <h2>A Break From Fantasy</h2>
          <h5>ART 74 | Glitch Art | Audacity, TextEdit</h5>
          <img
            src="https://cdn.glitch.me/ed8c583e-28ae-4141-aeb9-e53177706ad7%2FFantasy%20Glitched-1.png?v=1633546995647"

          <p>3514 x 1932 pixels</p>
          <p class="ex1"></p>
          <p>
            Using Audacity, I created distortions to this image, creating
            something very unique. The way the glitches themselves create an
            interesting new medium and texture to the original composition gives
            it a different vibe. The fantasy background makes it seem like the
            calm in the storm with the soft fantastical background clashing with
            the bright glitches like a "Break From Fantasy".

            The idea behind this was just being a cat, going through the daily
            routine as one with random antics and scenarios. Above is the link
            to the twine narrative.

            The skit was inspired by "Toy Story" or horror films that involve a
            doll/plush coming alive without the owner knowing. Here I wanted to
            have fun where instead of the human getting killed by the
            doll/plush, it goes the other way around.

            This artwork is an avatar that reacts to different functions. I
            chose a cat to be my avatar because even though I don’t have one, I
            love their attitude and their funny antics. I mainly like to draw
            cute things or art in anime style which I want to apply to future
            projects as my brand. Mouse clicking anywhere will change the eye
            color, hovering over specific areas will make the blush appear, and
            stars fall down the screen again and again rotating at different
            speeds.

          <p>
            This is a random meme generator that, given by the name, creates a
            meme. The reason for memes specifically is because memes always put
            a smile on a face. There's no universal message other than the
            generator itself being chaotic and hopefully gets a laugh or two.
            Because it's chaotic and random, the generator creates a different
            meme, face, phrase, and sound every time you click the generate
            button.

            This is an example of art pieces I mainly draw and work around with.
            This artwork was my take on ManyaDraws' drawing which I had both joy
            and agony participating in. The #DTIYS or Draw This in Your Style
            challenge, in the name itself, is where the original artist creates
            a original character and design and participants have to draw it in
            their style (free to adjust positions, gender, etc. as long as the
            character is still recognizable). It's an example of one of the
            challenges I like to join for fun or motivation to draw.

            The artwork was inspired by the theme for this concept, Zodiac. I
            chose the zodiac Aquarius, choosing certain elements to represent
            the zodiac itself with the iconic overflowing vase and having the
            color palette mainly blue as Aquarius is known as the "Water Bearer"
            and assocaites with the element of water.

            This was one a fun project for a challenge called Conceptober. In
            the name itself, it's a challenge where you get a theme per day
            (dates can vary) and create a concept art or character based on that
            theme. I personally found this more unique and creative in
            comparison to Inktober (same concept except you use ink to create
            your drawings). This is actually meant to be my original character
            for my story taking place in the anime, Overlord. She's supposed to
            be a Goddess Empress who can smite her foes with her fearsome magic
            and brutal strength. The Conceptober theme is based around "A Hero's
            Tale". It's a big representation of what my art is as I love to do
            character designs.

            This is another part of the Conceptober Challenge "A Hero's Tale",
            with this character being an ally to the previous artwork. Asten is
            a god who takes the form of a human to better understand humanity,
            wanting to walk the earth on two feet. His color palette was created
            with the idea that he serves the Empress so it's similar to
            Sirenia's colors but with rustic brown pants to relate back to his
            backstory of the god wanting to be like a human.

            This project is an example of one of the types of games I'm hoping
            to be able to make in the future. It was also a nice hands-on
            experiment with the RPG application "Ren.py" as it's known for
            creating RPG Games. Here I wanted to be able to bring my story to
            life with my characters. With my work revolving mainly around
            concept arts, character designs, and 2d illustrations, I have
            created a visual novel using one of my stories/fanfictions. When the
            project was first introduced, I immediately had the idea to create
            an interactive story using one of my stories. Examples of Visual
            Novel games would include Dream Daddy or Doki Doki Literature Club.
            The story is based on the anime Overlord. For those unaware of the
            story, it’s about a young man who is trapped within a video game as
            his avatar, an overlord mage of darkness, and sets out to make this
            new world his own empire, slowly losing his morality the further he
            expands his empire and plays the role of Ainz Ooal Gown. My idea was
            what if Ainz wasn’t the only one trapped in Yggdrasil and is the
            complete opposite of him hence Sirenia Astera was created. With her
            point of view, she will slowly learn to trust the people around her
            and aid humanity in her role as the Goddess Empress.
