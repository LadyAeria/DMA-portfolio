            My work mainly revolves around digital 2D illustrations and concept
            art for characters. My art style is anime-influenced as anime was a
            big eye-opener when it came to art and animation, yet professional
            teachers don't consider anime as an art because it's "too easy"
            which baffles me. If someone considered a pair of
            glasses accidentally placed on the floor "art", what makes anime any
            less? With my art style, I'm hoping people can open up to new forms
            of art because there are many types that some people not aware of.
            The drawings I usually draw are portraits, concept designs, fan
            arts, and submissions for art challenges. I dream of working for
            video game companies to create concept designs and characters
            because video games transfer you to another universe. I find
            fictional characters very immersive and like many characters people
            create, they take on a personality of their own which people love or
            hate. I want to create stories following around a character in a
            fictional fantasy world that people can enjoy and even relate to. I
            want to be able to make amazing lore and new characters that people
            have not been able to experience. Video games themselves have moral
            messages that people don’t realize, and the stories created within
            these platforms are breathtaking whether they are just for laughs
            and games or deep and meaningful. I want to create a character,
            whether they are a protagonist, antagonist, or side character, and
            have people enjoy their unique design and personality. The overall
            goal for me as an artist is to create. I hope to learn and create
            concept arts and designs for characters in future games, to create
            an immersive story with unique characters, and I want to have people
            have fun and enjoy in general and lose themselves as they get
            transported into another universe.
