            My work mainly revolves around digital 2D illustrations and concept art for my own or sometimes other people’s characters. My art style is anime-influenced as anime was a big eye-opener to me when it came to art and animation. It was my stepping stones to developing my own art style, yet professional teachers do not consider anime as an art because it's "too easy" which baffles me. If someone considered a pair of glasses accidentally placed on the floor "art" or even the debate about a banana taped to the wall “art”, what makes anime any less? It still requires practice and adjustments as there are many distinct styles under the anime category that are unique and beautiful in their own way like many other well known art styles. With my art style, I'm hoping people can open up to new forms of art because there are many types that some people are not aware of or are not open to. I usually draw portraits, concept designs, fan arts, and submissions for art challenges. Sometimes I like to make my artworks humorous to get a good giggle or two out of people. I dream of working for video game companies to create concept designs and characters because video games transfer you to another universe. I find fictional characters very immersive and like many characters people create, they take on a personality of their own which people love or hate. I want to create stories following a character in a fictional fantasy world that people can enjoy and even relate to, to make amazing lore and new characters that people may not have been able to experience yet. Video games themselves have moral messages that people don’t realize, a gateway of sorts to sharing a bigger message in a different medium, and the stories created within these platforms are breathtaking whether they are just for laughs and games or deep and meaningful. I want to create a character, whether they are a protagonist, antagonist, or side character, and have people enjoy their unique design and personality. The overall goal for me as an artist is to create. I hope to learn and create concept arts and designs for characters in future games, to create an immersive story with unique characters, and I want to have people have fun and enjoy in general and lose themselves as they get transported into another universe.
